Thanks for visiting my page!

I am a full stack web developer located in the greater Boston area.

In the summer of 2016, I enrolled in Bloc's 6 month full stack web development course, learning HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and AngularJS and jQuery. I love problem solving, learning new technologies, being part of such a great community of developers.

My previous employment has been as a chef, but I am looking to make a career change into the technology industry as a web developer.  I have learned many valuable skills as a chef, like time management, working with a team, and seeing a task through with the customer and end goal in mind.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, fishing, going to the beach, and spending time with friends and family.
