title: Overcoming Challenges
---

Since I've started programming, there has been one consistency: having to overcome challenges. Whether it is something that I did not know how to do, a mistake made when writing code(semi-colons), or simply not being in the right mindset, there always seems to be something.

But that's part of the appeal of programming. That is what makes it so fun, so rewarding, and makes us as programmers coming back for more everyday.

The community has an abundance of resources available to those in need, i.e. documentation, stack overflow, slack communities, etc. These are all my go to places when I come across a road bump.  But sometimes, there is something that is even more beneficial to me: **stepping away from the computer**.

Have you ever stared at a problem for what seems like forever? *How do I fix this?*

 **Get up and walk away**.

I find myself realizing how to solve problems if I step outside and take a walk, or go make some food and talk out loud about the problem I'm facing.  Sometimes just saying what it is out loud that you need help with, and talking through your problems, will bring you to a sudden realization of what the solution actually is.

Even if there is no sudden epiphany, simply taking a break, clearing your head, and stepping away can help you overcome challenges.

Happy coding!
