title: My First Alexa Skill

I have recently completed my first Alexa Trivia Skill and had it published to the Alexa app through Amazon Web Services(AWS). Let me start by saying that Amazon does an amazing job making this process as painless as possible.
This being my first attempt at making a skill, I used one of their templates that are available here, and followed this handy resource.
The best part of this process for me was seeing my work so quickly. Once you get your environment set up through AWS, it is fairly easy to get a basic skill up and running. If you have an Alexa enabled device, all you have to do is go to your app store and your prototype will be there for you to test out. It gives you a chance to make sure the question sounds right through the speech interpreter, and the questions are easy to follow along with.
I found that the most challenging thing was getting to the point where you can start making up some fun questions and hearing them through your device. Although there was a comprehensive guide, it still felt unfamiliar navigating through AWS and connecting my account to their Lambda service.
I am eager to make my next skill and continue exploring all the cool features that AWS provides. I encourage anyone interested in this to go for it! It was a fun process and it took only a day for Amazon to approve my skill submission.
Oh yea, checkout my skill, its called “Whale games”.
